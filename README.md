# SSW 540 - Fundamentals of Software Engineering

**Welcome to Fundamentals of Software Engineering.** </br>
</br>
Professor: [Raz Saremi, Ph.D.](mailto:rsaremi@stevens.edu) </br>
</br>
Available for virtual office meetings or by appointment </br>

## IMPORTANT COURSE INFO - PLEASE READ

We use a primary textbook in this course: [Ian Sommerville's Software Engineering, 10th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-10th-Ian-Sommerville/dp/0133943038/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Ian+Sommerville%27s+Software+Engineering&qid=1641488883&sr=8-1) </br>
</br>
Group Project Assignments are due on Wednesday at 11:59 pm. Bi-Weekly Quizzes are due Sunday at 11:59 pm. Canvas does not permit students to take quizzes after their due date/time. If you must miss a quiz, please arrange with the professor for an alternative before the due date. </br>
</br>
There are assignments for each week. For each day late, I will subtract 5% from assignment submitted after their due date. When warranted, extensions will be granted before assignments are due. </br>
</br>
Each week's lecture slides will be posted on Canvas and recorded during the session for your later review. Since the classroom time will be divided between lecture and hands-on work, it's very important that youcread the assigned textbook cahpters BRFORE the online lecture. </br>
</br>
An open book quiz is given about every 2nd week, covering that and the previous weeks' material since the last quiz. </br>
</br>
Each week students will prepare and submit a group assignment. Part of the classroom activity will be devoted to hands-on work on the weekly group assignment. You will be asked to evaluate your teammates at the end of the course on the quality and quantity of their contributions. Be a good teammate and your group will prosper! </br>
</br>
If you have any questions, [email me](mailto:rsaremi@stevens.edu). I strive to return all emails within 24 hours. </br>
</br>
I look forward to a great term!
